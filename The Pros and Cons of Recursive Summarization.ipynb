    "# The Pros and Cons of Recursive Summarization\n",
    "\n",
    "[Summarization AI models](https://krixik-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/modules/ai_modules/summarize_module/) take text input and return a summarized version of the text. The models are built and trained in a variety of ways, and thus have different approaches to summarization: for instance, some may be prone to removing certain sentences/words and keeping others, while others might actively rewrite sentences/phrases/paragraphs into shorter versions that retain key meaning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Certain models may have a paremeterizable 'degree of summarization' through which the user can specify how much shorter than the original text the summary should be. This same effect can be achieved with models that don't offer this option through [recursive summarization](https://krixik-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples/multi_module_non_search_pipeline_examples/multi_recursive_summarization/), which involves sequentially applying the summarization function several times on the same text, each time feeding the output of the previous iteration as the input of the following one.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Recursive summarization](https://krixik-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples/multi_module_non_search_pipeline_examples/multi_recursive_summarization/) offers appealing upside:\n",
    "\n",
    "- By determining how many times summarization is applied, degree of summarization can be specified.\n",
    "- Running a small summarization model several times may be more cost-effective than running a very advanced and parameterizable summarization model once.\n",
    "- Different sequential combinations of [summarization models](https://krixik-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/modules/ai_modules/summarize_module/#available-models-in-the-summarize-module) yield a wider variety of results. For instance, you may find that recursing with one model but ending with another provides a result closer to what you seek.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, recursively summarizing also has its downsides:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Recursion may unwittingly summarize away a core element of the text.\n",
    "- Since summarization involves transforming the text, its meaning may be changed over several iterations.\n",

    "This summary is of much lesser quality than the thrice-over summary from the previous example. This may be because the text was longer, and thus trickier to summarize, or because its non-narrative nature agreed with the model less. This may also have come to pass because the [text summarization](https://huggingface.co/Falconsai/text_summarization) model is inferior to the [module](https://krixik-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/modules/ai_modules/summarize_module/#available-models-in-the-summarize-module)'s default model, [bart-large-cnn](https://huggingface.co/facebook/bart-large-cnn)—although, of course, all models have their limitations. Whatever the case, important sections of the text are entirely removed (such as the portion about \"stolen\" training data), and other sections have been spliced in a way that no longer makes sense, like the fourth-paragraph reference to \"grandma\".\n",

    "If you believe that recursive summarization is the path forward for you, experimenting with different models, number of iterations, and model combinations will yield valuable insight into what the best setup for you and your texts is. Prototyping with [Krixik pipelines](https://krixik-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) will allow you to run these experiments quickly, clearly, and cost-effectively. For instance, how would the result of running our <u>1984</u> excerpt through the [text summarization](https://huggingface.co/Falconsai/text_summarization) model compare to our above result through the default model? Instantiate a pipeline, give it a shot, and find out!"
